/**
 * Exercise:
 *
 * FizzBuzz Function
 *
 * Work in the console, or use "console.log()" to output to the console
 * from the script
 *
 * The FizzBuzz rules...
 *  - for numbers that are a multiple of 3,
 *    log "Fizz" instead of the number
 *  - for numbers that are a multiple of 5
 *    log "Buzz" instead of the number
 *  - for numbers that are a multiple of both,
 *    log "FizzBuzz" instead of just Fizz or Buzz
 *
 * 1) Implement the fizzbuzz function:
 *  - It accepts a single number argument
 *  - Outputs the correct response to the console based on the FizzBuzz rules
 *
 * 2) Create a loop that executes your fizzbuzz function for the numbers from 1 to 100
 *
 * 3) BONUS 1 - write tests
 * use console.assert() to verify your function works as expected
 * ex: console.assert(fizzbuzz(3) === "Fizz");
 *
 * 4) BONUS 2 - refactor your function
 *

function fizzbuzz(n) {
  // 1) implement the function
}

// 2) run the function with a loop

// 3) BONUS 1
// use console.assert() to test your function
