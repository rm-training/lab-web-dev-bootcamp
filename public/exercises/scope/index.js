/**
 * Exercise:
 *
 * Function Scope
 *
 * Using "console.log()" to output to the console
 * from the script to verify your solutions
 *
 * You could also use console.assert(boolean) to test your functions
 *
 * Part 1:
 * Write two functions that share the same, global variable
 * Verify this by:
 * - logging the value of the variable to the console from within each function
 * - logging the value from outside the functions; this should work
 */

// WRITE YOUR SOLUTION TO PART 1 HERE

/*
 * Part 2:
 * Write two functions that share a non-global variable
 * Verify this by:
 * - logging the value of the variable to the console from within each function
 * - attempting to log the value from the global scope; it should throw an error
 *
 * Hint: You can write functions inside of other functions...
 */

// WRITE YOUR SOLUTION TO PART 2 HERE

/*
 * Bonus: Write a function (outer) that returns another function (inner)
 *
 * The outer function expects one integer parameter, x
 * The inner function should add 1 to x and log it to the console
 * Calling the outer function returns the inner
 * You will need to run the outer ONCE to get the inner, then test the inner
 *
 * Notice how the scope of the inner function will be maintained within the outer
 * This is a closure
